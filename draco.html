    <h1>Draco Malfoy</h1>
    <img src="download (5).jfif">
    <p>Draco Malfoy encounters Harry Potter for the first in at Madam Malkins. Draco thinks that muggle-born witches and wizards should be denied a magical education. Harry Potter was a child whose parents were murdered by the powerful dark wizard Lord Voldemort. Draco engages him in a conversation. Draco then proclaims that "the other sort" (Muggle-borns) should not be allowed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
    Wizardry, because "they've never been brought up to know our ways". The two boys part without introductions, but meet
    again on the Hogwarts Express. After Draco ridicules Ron Weasley's family, Harry rejects his offer of friendship,
    demonstrated by a handshake, and their mutual antagonism is born. At the first years' Sorting Ceremony, the Sorting Hat places him instantly into Slytherin, the house that has developed
    all of the bad wizards, where he becomes an instant favourite of Potions teacher and Slytherin Head of House, Severus
    Snape, an apparent follower of Lord Voldemort. Draco attempts to get Harry expelled by falsely challenging him to a
    midnight duel and informing Argus Filch in advance of Harry's plans to be out of bed; Draco's attempt fails when Harry
    evades Filch and safely makes it back to his dormitory. </p>
