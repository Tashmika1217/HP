    <h1>Rubeus Hagrid</h1>
    <img src="download (7).jfif">
    <p>Following the murder of James and Lily Potter by Lord Voldemort, Albus Dumbledore entrusts Hagrid with the infant Harry
    Potter, who survived Voldemort's attack. Ten years later, Hagrid brings the Philosopher's Stone from Gringotts Wizarding
    Bank to Hogwarts, where it is guarded by an enormous three-headed dog named Fluffy. Dumbledore also gives Hagrid the
    task of locating Harry and helping him buy school supplies for his first year at Hogwarts.
    <br>
    Later in the novel, a hooded person—Professor Quirinus Quirrell in disguise—gives Hagrid a dragon egg in exchange for
    details about Fluffy. Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are also curious about Fluffy, and Hagrid
    lets slip that the way to get past him is to play music. When Harry and his friends decide to seek the Philosopher's
    Stone, they soothe Fluffy to sleep with a flute which Hagrid carved for Harry. When the dragon egg hatches, the three
    friends assist Hagrid by helping to remove the baby dragon Norbert, who is taken to a dragon sanctuary in
    Romania.</p>
