    <h1>Harry Potter</h1>
    <img src="images (3).jfif">
    <p>Harry James Potter is a half-blood wizard born on July 31, 1980, sorted into Gryffindor, and best known to the wizarding
    world as the Boy Who Lived, though he personally despises the fame attached to that title. Orphaned as a baby by Lord
    Voldemort and raised in an abusive, loveless environment, Harry grows up craving belonging and fairness, which shapes
    him into someone deeply loyal, morally driven, and fiercely protective of the people he loves.<br> His natural courage and
    instinctive leadership emerge early, not because he seeks power or recognition, but because he cannot stand by when
    others are in danger or treated unjustly, a trait that repeatedly pushes him into reckless, impulsive decisions.<br>
    Emotionally, Harry carries immense trauma and grief, often manifesting as anger, isolation, and a tendency to shoulder
    responsibility alone, yet he never allows suffering to harden him into cruelty. He forms profound bonds with Ron
    Weasley, who offers him warmth and family, and Hermione Granger, who grounds him intellectually and ethically, while his
    complicated relationships with figures like Dumbledore and Snape reflect his ongoing struggle with trust, authority, and
    hidden truths.<br> Gifted in Defense Against the Dark Arts and known for his holly wand with a phoenix feather core and his
    stag Patronus, Harry’s greatest strength is not magical skill but his capacity for love, empathy, and choice, ultimately
    proving that destiny does not define a person—decisions do, and even in a world shaped by darkness, compassion remains
    the most powerful force of all. </p>
