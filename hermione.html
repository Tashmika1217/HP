    <h1>Hermione Granger</h1>
    <img src="download (8).jfif">
    <p>Hermione Granger, one of the central protagonists of the Harry Potter series, is a Muggle-born Gryffindor defined by
    exceptional intelligence, moral conviction, and strategic courage.<br> Academically brilliant and deeply analytical, she
    relies on knowledge, research, and logic to solve problems, often providing the critical solutions that keep Harry and
    Ron alive. Though initially rule-oriented and eager to prove herself, she grows into an ethically independent thinker
    who breaks rules when justice demands it, driven by a fierce sense of equality and compassion for the marginalized, as
    seen in her advocacy for house-elves and opposition to blood prejudice.<br> Her bravery is calculated rather than reckless,
    her loyalty profound, and her emotional depth evident in sacrifices such as altering her parents’ memories for their
    safety. While she can be bossy, perfectionistic, and impatient with incompetence, her growth from an insecure, socially
    awkward student into a confident leader underscores her role as the intellectual and moral backbone of the trio,
    symbolizing the power of knowledge guided by conscience.</p>
