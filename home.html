    <h2>Harry Potter and the philosophers stone</h2> <br>
    <img src="images (1).jfif" height="450" width="640"> <br>
    <p>Harry Potter lives with his abusive uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, and their bullying, spoiled son, Dudley. On Harry's
    eleventh birthday, he learns that he is a wizard when a man named Rubeus Hagrid invites him to attend Hogwarts, a school
    of magic. Hagrid explains that when Harry was an infant, a Dark wizard named Voldemort murdered his parents and tried to
    kill him as well. However, Voldemort's killing curse rebounded and seemingly destroyed him, leaving a lightning
    bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead.
    
    Hagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley, where the latter discovers his fame among wizards while buying a wand, an owl named
    Hedwig, and other school supplies. A month later, Harry takes the Hogwarts Express to Hogwarts. He befriends Ron
    Weasley, a first-year student, during the journey. He also meets Hermione Granger and has a confrontation with Draco
    Malfoy. At Hogwarts, a magical Sorting Hat assigns each first-year student to a House. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are
    assigned to Gryffindor, although the Hat considers putting Harry in Slytherin.</p> <br>
    <h2>Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets</h2> <br>
    <img src="download.jfif" height="450" width="640"> <br>
    <p>While Harry Potter spends the summer with the Dursleys, Dobby, a house-elf, warns Harry of an "impending danger" at
    Hogwarts. He attempts to prevent him returning to Hogwarts by sabotaging an important dinner with Vernon Dursley's
    client. Vernon tries to prevent his departure in retaliation, but his friend Ron Weasley and his brothers Fred and
    George rescue him in their father's flying car. Harry meets up with Hermione Granger in Diagon Alley, where they meet
    Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, along with Draco Malfoy and his father, Lucius,
    who Harry sees slip a book into Ginny Weasley's cauldron.
    
    After being blocked from entering Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at King's Cross railway station, Harry and Ron fly
    the car to Hogwarts, where they crash into the Whomping Willow. Ron's wand is broken, and they each receive detention,
    during which Harry hears a strange voice and subsequently finds caretaker Argus Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, petrified with
    a message written in blood: "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware." One of Hogwarts'
    founders, Salazar Slytherin, supposedly constructed a secret Chamber containing a monster that only his heir can
    control, capable of purging the school of Muggle-borns. Suspecting Malfoy to be the heir, Harry, Ron, and Hermione plan
    to question him.</p> <br>
    <h2>Harry Potter and the prisoner of azkaban</h2> <br>
    <img src="images (2).jfif" height="450" width="640"> <br>
    <p>During another unhappy summer with the Dursleys, Harry Potter becomes enraged when Vernon's sister Marge viciously
    insults his parents and accidentally causes her to inflate and float away. Expecting to be expelled from Hogwarts for
    using magic outside school, Harry runs away but is picked up by the Knight Bus and taken to The Leaky Cauldron, where
    Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge assures Harry that he will not face punishment. Upon reuniting with his best friends
    Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry learns that Sirius Black, an alleged supporter of Lord Voldemort, has escaped
    Azkaban prison and is expected to come after Harry.
    
    While journeying to Hogwarts, the Hogwarts Express is boarded by Dementors, ghostly prison guards searching for Black;
    one of them causes Harry to faint, but the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, repels it using a
    Patronus Charm. At Hogwarts, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore announces that Dementors will patrol the school until Black is
    captured. Hagrid is appointed as the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, but his first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy
    provokes a hippogriff named Buckbeak to attack him; as a result, Draco's father has Buckbeak sentenced to death.</p> <br>
