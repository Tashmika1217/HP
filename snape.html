    <h1>Severus Snape</h1>
    <img src="download (9).jfif">
    <p>Severus Snape is one of the most complex and morally ambiguous characters in the Harry Potter series, defined by
    bitterness, brilliance, secrecy, and enduring, tragic love.<br> A Half-Blood Slytherin and exceptionally gifted wizard,
    Snape is cold, sarcastic, and often cruel, particularly toward students, masking deep emotional wounds from childhood
    neglect, social rejection, and his lifelong unrequited love for Lily Potter.<br> Initially aligned with the Death Eaters out
    of resentment and a desire for belonging, he defects after Lily’s life is threatened and becomes a double agent for
    Dumbledore, living for years under constant suspicion and personal torment. His actions are driven less by heroism than
    by guilt, loyalty, and a private vow to protect Lily’s son, Harry, whom he simultaneously resents and safeguards.<br> Snape
    embodies themes of redemption, sacrifice, and moral grayness: he is neither traditionally good nor evil, but a man
    shaped by pain who ultimately chooses a path of dangerous, unseen service.<br> His courage is quiet and thankless, his love
    obsessive yet transformative, and his legacy rests on the revelation that much of his cruelty concealed a long, perilous
    commitment to bringing down Voldemort from within.</p>
