    <h1>Tom Riddle</h1>
    <img src="images (4).jfif">
    <p>Tom Riddle, later known as Lord Voldemort, is portrayed as a brilliant yet deeply disturbed wizard whose intelligence,
    charm, and ambition are corrupted by a profound fear of death and an obsessive desire for power and control. Born to a
    loveless union and raised in an orphanage, Riddle grows up emotionally detached, manipulative, and unable to form
    genuine human bonds, viewing others as tools to be used rather than people to be valued.<br> Exceptionally talented at
    Hogwarts, especially in magic that pushes ethical boundaries, he becomes fascinated with immortality and purity of
    blood, developing a belief in his own superiority and a contempt for weakness.<br> His inability to understand love,
    empathy, or sacrifice shapes his transformation into Voldemort, leading him to create Horcruxes, build a following
    through fear, and pursue domination over both the magical and non-magical worlds.<br> Riddle embodies the theme of potential
    corrupted by choice, showing how intelligence without conscience and ambition without humanity can lead to moral decay
    and self-destruction.</p>
